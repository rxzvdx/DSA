I learned about Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and how they are mostly
used for efficiency in searching, insertion, and deletion operations 
on a collection of elements. BSTs are a type of binary tree in which 
each node has at most two children, and each node's left child has a key 
value less than its own key value, while its right child has a key value 
greater than its own key value. This ordering property allows for fast 
search and insertion operations, making BSTs useful for implementing 
data structures like sets and maps.
