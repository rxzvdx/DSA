This lab was easily the most helpful lab as far as learning is concerned. I found the implementation of a Circular Doubly Linked Structure to be insanely efficient and is easily the most advanced material I have dabbled with thus far as a programmer. While I won't say I'm an expert in calculating space/time complexity for algorithms, I still found the investigation to be informative and hopefully in the future I can utilize it to figure out what methods to implement for programs in the future.
