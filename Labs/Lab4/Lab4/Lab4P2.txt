a) Space Complexity analysis:

The CDLS implementation uses class DNode that itself contains 3 instance variables.
Those being:
An object reference to the item stored in DNode.
A reference to the next DNode in the list.
A reference to the previous DNode in the list.

ListCDLSBased contains two instance variables.
Those being:
An Object reference to the first item in DNode
An int to keep track of the number of items in DNode

Each object reference should take 4 bytes so each DNode would require 4 * 4 = 16 bytes. The number of DNodes in the list is stored in the "numItems" variable which takes 4 bytes. So, the total space complexity of the CDLS implementation is O(16 * n + 4) = O(16n + 4), where n is the number of items in the list.

b) Time Complexity analysis:

get(int index) - The "find" method is called to find the item at the specified index. The find method has a time complexity of O(n/2) in the worst-case scenario where n is the number of items in the list. So, the overall time complexity of the "get" method is O(n/2) + O(1) = O(n/2), where O(1) represents the time taken to return the node item.

add(int index, Object item): The "find" method is again called to find the DNode before the specified index. The find method has a time complexity of O(n/2) in the worst-case scenario where n is the number of items in the list. So, the overall time complexity of the "add" method is O(n/2) + O(1) = O(n/2), where O(1) represents the time taken to add the item.

remove(int index): The "find" method is called to find the DNode at the specified index. The find method has a time complexity of O(n/2) in the worst-case scenario where n is the number of items in the list. So, the overall time complexity of the "remove" method is O(n/2) + O(1) = O(n/2), where O(1) represents the time taken to remove the item.

As a result, the average time complexity of the CDLS implementation is O(n/2).
