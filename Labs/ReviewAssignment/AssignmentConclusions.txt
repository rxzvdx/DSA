This assignment was definitely a refresher for me and helped me remember a ton of IOOP and OOPDA material. It sort of encapsulated everything (at least the important things) that I was taught in those courses all in one program. I feel a little more comfortable with lambdas because of this assignment as before, I'll admit I was a bit iffy on them besides doing simple things like using the .forEach method or printing something.
