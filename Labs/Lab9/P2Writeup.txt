Time Complexity:
Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by taking each element from an unsorted list and placing it in its correct position in a sorted list. Improved Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that arranges each element of an unsorted list into its appropriate position in a sorted list. Unlike the original algorithm, Improved Insertion Sort uses binary search to locate the correct position of each element, rather than comparing it with all previous elements.

To analyze the time complexity of Improved Insertion Sort, one can consider the number of comparisons and element movements required to sort the input list. In the worst-case scenario, when the input list is in reverse order, each element would need to be compared with all previous elements, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2).

However, by using binary search, the number of comparisons required for each element decreases, resulting in a more efficient algorithm. The number of comparisons needed for each element is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the sorted sub-list, leading to a best-case time complexity of O(n log n) when the input list is already sorted.

On average, Improved Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is slower than other efficient sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort and Quick Sort. However, Improved Insertion Sort has the advantage of being an in-place sorting algorithm, which means that it does not require extra memory space to perform the sorting operation.

Therefore, the time complexity of Improved Insertion Sort can be expressed as O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n log n) in the best case, and O(n^2) in the average case.
