Problem 1:
Status update 1:
Output separates correctly due to for loop, but only displays total number of people rather than separating i.e. "name number 1" "name number 2" etc.

Status update 2: 
Name number lines now separated, but "shouts Hello" line is missing, only first name displays.

Status update 3:
Names all combined with no "and" for ex: "Tony and Joe".

Status update 4: 
All names besides last are concatenated if more than 3. 

Status update 5:
Accidental extra space between commas.

Status update 6:
Statement repeats itself, incorrect output.

Status update 7:
Output is correct with 2 people.

Status update 8:
Output is correct entirely. 

Problem 2:
Status update 1: 
Output fully functional for when user input equals zero, everything else non functional. 

Status update 2:
Output correctly interprets number of pairs to amount of lines needed for number and weight. 

Status update 3:
Program is fully functional with correct output except that weighted mean is not divided by total of all weight(s). Simple mean is correct. 

Problem 3:
Status update 1:
Everything is functional except for Each + method ref and palindrome

Status update 2:
Palindrome still not operating

Status update 3:
ERROR RESOLVED: missing break lines

Output fully functional.
