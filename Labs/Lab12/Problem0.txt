To compute the nth power of 32 efficiently using only one multiplication operation, we can use the property that 32^n 
is equivalent to (2^5)^n, which simplifies to 2^(5n). Therefore, we can compute the nth power of 32 as:

int nthpowerof32 = 1 << (5*n); // using bit shift instead of multiplication

To compute the rank of an upper-case character in alphabetic order, we can subtract the Unicode value of 
'A' from the Unicode value of the character and add 1. This works because the Unicode values of the 
uppercase letters are assigned in consecutive order.

char c = 'D'; // example character
int rank = c - 'A' + 1;
